[Sulu](https://sulu.io/) is a highly extensible open-source **PHP content management system based** on the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework. Sulu is developed to deliver robust **multi-lingual and multi-portal websites** while providing an **intuitive and extensible administration interface** to manage the full content lifecycle. 

Have a look at the official [Sulu website](https://sulu.io/) for a comprehensive list of Sulu's features, core values and use cases.

# Plant & Track
The app's purpose is to assist as a catalogging tool for the process of plant collecting. This desktop application utilizes user input to create and host the plant collection and ultimately helps a forgetful plant owner track their daily obsession! After long term use of the application, a user should be able to utilize their catalogging for the seasons to come!

##General Installation:
1.Upon Starting up Plant & Track, press the Login button and then click "Register"...
  ![Register](https://res.cloudinary.com/triggsumms/image/upload/v1597688546/CapstoneSumms/wisa4qrfl6qvqfse6mo5.png)
1.Then a User will be directed to the Home page, containing the current plant Collection.
  ![HomePAGE](https://res.cloudinary.com/triggsumms/image/upload/v1597688570/CapstoneSumms/yzeeq6w9lg6dtiannnlw.png)
1.The user will have a profile card created and an option to edit their user information or create a new plant will be available
  ![USERCARD](https://res.cloudinary.com/triggsumms/image/upload/v1597688601/CapstoneSumms/fx4i1jtxqcpxnmcosqxa.png)
1.At this point a USer will have 3 views of the cards avaialble. The collection view, details(editing) view, and upon flipping the card......a view of Journal Entries.

## Directions from Login
<picture>
  
## After Creating an account: 
1. The user will have an example card pre-loaded to their library, to exhibit a what a fully rendered card is capable of.
1. The User can begin building their collection, In which they will click the "New Plant" button located on the User Profile and fill out all the nescessary forms. After creating a Plant Card, a user can add Images/Edit the information via the details button!
1. The User can also flip the card using a button toggle! This will allow them to enter in their journal entries for the plant and chronologically reference the most recent entries!
1. Now enjoy you collections Longevity or placement in the Graveyard! 
Lastly, A key of the buttons is located below...


## Concepts Covered
Concepts covered in this project include: 
* Session storage
* Creating a JSON database
* CRUD functionality with API fetch calls to JSON server
* Associating that data with a userID
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript 
* React.js.... the list will be updated throughout the project's span.



## Brief User Attraction
This app is geared towards the average ‚ÄúPlant Enthusiast‚Äù. The application will allow said user to build a library for journaling, referencing, and ultimately tracking their ‚Äúovergrown‚Äù collections. The app is meant for the daily user, and the main function should mimic that of a daily journal!

## A Few Application Features:
This app will login (User1) and contain a library of ‚ÄúplantCards‚Äù in which they have created over their history with the app.\
In this library a (User1) will be able to post new plantCards‚Ä¶..& (delete dead plantCards or Edit/Update the cards with old or current growth status(s). 
Through the sorting of this (User1)‚Äôs library, a certain management will be revealed for (User1). 
* The app will exhibit their plantCards in the order in which the cards were created (via timeStamp)
* The User can select specific cards through a search input, allowing species with ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù naming characteristics to be revealed. 
* This same search feature will be implemented in a library for just the ‚Äúdead plantCards‚Äù so a reference exists for the next season‚Ä¶. (Just in case a user wants to have a reference to prior mistakes made).
* Key journal variables will exist inside the plantCard, such as the use of a color tag via the card. (INSTRUCTOR: see sketchboard PlantCARD)
