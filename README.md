# PlantBaby Tracker
The app's purpose is to stand as a catalogging journal for plant collecting!


## Concepts Covered
Concepts covered in this project include: 
* Session storage
* Creating a JSON database
* CRUD functionality with API fetch calls to JSON server
* Associating that data with a userID
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript 
* React.js.... the list will be updated throughout the project's span.



## Brief User Attraction
This app is geared towards the average “Plant Enthusiast”. The application will allow said user to build a library for journaling, referencing, and ultimately tracking their “overgrown” collections. The app is meant for the daily user, and the main function should mimic that of a daily journal!

## A Few Application Features:
This app will login (User1) and contain a library of “plantCards” in which they have created over their history with the app.\
In this library a (User1) will be able to post new plantCards…..& (delete dead plantCards or Edit/Update the cards with old or current growth status(s). 
Through the sorting of this (User1)’s library, a certain management will be revealed for (User1). 
* The app will exhibit their plantCards in the order in which the cards were created (via timeStamp)
* The User can select specific cards through a search input, allowing species with “similar” naming characteristics to be revealed. 
* This same search feature will be implemented in a library for just the “dead plantCards” so a reference exists for the next season…. (Just in case a user wants to have a reference to prior mistakes made).
* Key journal variables will exist inside the plantCard, such as the use of a color tag via the card. (INSTRUCTOR: see sketchboard PlantCARD)
