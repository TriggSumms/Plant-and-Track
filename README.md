[Plant & Track](https://github.com/TriggSumms/Plant-and-Track)'s purpose is to assist as a catalogging tool for the process of plant collecting.

After long term use of the application, a user should be able to utilize their catalogging for the seasons to come!

In this library a (User1) will be able to post new plantCards‚Ä¶..& (delete dead plantCards or Edit/Update the cards with old or current growth status(s). 
Through the sorting of this (User1)‚Äôs library, a certain management will be revealed for (User1). 
* The app will exhibit their plantCards in the order in which the cards were created (via timeStamp)
* The User can select specific cards through a search input, allowing species with ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù naming characteristics to be revealed. 
* This same search feature will be implemented in a library for just the ‚Äúdead plantCards‚Äù so a reference exists for the next season‚Ä¶. (Just in case a user wants to have a reference to prior mistakes made).
* Key journal variables will exist inside the plantCard

## Concepts Covered
